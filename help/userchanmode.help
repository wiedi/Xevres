chanmode (Lvl. 0)
---------------------------------------
Syntax:	chanflag <#channel> [<+|-><flags>] [arguments]
Desc.:	This command can be used to set chanmodes without having 
	the operator chanmode, but you need to have at least the
	operator accessflag. It can be used analog to the MODE command
	of the ircd.
Example: chanmode #chan +mko geheim hans
	Sets the channel #chan moderated, sets a channel key "geheim" and 
	gives the user hans operator status.
